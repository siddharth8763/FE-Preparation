// By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, 
// when ProductPage re-renders with a different theme, the ShippingForm component also re-renders. 
// This is fine for components that donâ€™t require much calculation to re-render. 
// But if you verified a re-render is slow, 
// you can tell ShippingForm to skip re-rendering when its props 
// are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:


const ShippingForm = React.memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) {
  // ...
});
